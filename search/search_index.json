The discovered vulnerability allows attackers to upload files with dangerous file types and execute code with high integrity/privileges. What is Write-Back? Write-Back is a Tableau extension that enables users to submit data directly from a Tableau dashboard to your database, allowing them to implement any actionable use case without leaving the analysis flow. Write-Back allows users to take the Tableau usage further and implement use cases where you need users to input data, such as forecasting, planning, adding comments, or any actionable process. Includes features like on-premises execution, audit, multiple back-end databases, and integrated authentication. Before diving into more technical details, we should describe the layout of Write-Back\u2019s high-level back-end architecture: Write-Back (Server) : Tableau extensions are web-based and deployed on a separate application server from the Tableau Server/Cloud. This means that Write-Back should be placed side by side with Tableau, ideally on a separate machine. Users will interact with the Write-Back extension through the Tableau dashboards on different Tableau platforms, i.e., Tableau Desktop, Tableau Server, or even Tableau Cloud. Write-Back Manager : Centralizes all configurations and enables platform administrators to fully control how Write-Back is configured. All of this is done on a web UI. Each Write-Back installation has its own Write-Back manager deployed on the same machine, allowing one to manage that instance. Technical Description We consider this vulnerability to be the most complex of all four since it will chain together some of the previously publicated, namely CVE-2023-27170 and CVE-2023-27172. It has been assigned with the ID CVE-2023-27168 and is caused by an unrestricted file type upload security flaw on the Write-Back manager. The security flaw was initially detected when using the custom logo upload feature on a local installation. It was quickly observed in the web front-end code that there wasn't any file or content type validation in the upload form, allowing us to load and submit a file completely unrelated to an image file. Figure 1: Logo Upload HTTP request Receiving the \"INVALID_FILE_EXTENSION\" error message was not a complete dead end; it just meant there was some kind of validation being done by the server. Looking at the source code: Figure 2: Valid file extensions. Supposedly, the only acceptable extensions are .jpg , .png and .jpeg , but looking at the logos folder, after multiple attempts to upload invalid file types, shows otherwise: Figure 3: Logo upload folder. It seems the Write-Back Manager, despite answering our malicious upload attempt with an error, actually wrote the files onto the file system. At this point, we can confirm the existence of an unrestricted file upload vulnerability since it was possible to upload files with a file extension which was not explicitly authorised. Taking a look at the source code, we can narrow down the cause of this vulnerability to a very simple mistake: the file extension is validated after the file has been written to disk, and the error handling routines do not delete the invalid file when the InvalidFileExtentionException is thrown. Figure 4: The root cause of CVE-2023-27168. Since this same code pattern was reused on other file upload endpoints, the SSL certificate and JBDC driver upload features were also affected. Coupled with CVE-2023-27170 , which allows for directory traversal by introducing special characters in the filename, a malicious user can achieve remote code execution with the same integrity level as the service which is running the web server. Now, considering the Write-Back Manager and its Apache Tomcat instance are running under NT Authority/System , an attacker can take full control of the vulnerable system: Figure 5: Webshell upload. A .jsp webshell was used to demonstrate the exploitation and privilege level acquired: Figure 6: OS command execution through jsp webshell. Chaining everything together with CVE-2023-27172 allows an unauthenticated attacker to take over a vulnerable Write-Back Manager instance. Impact This vulnerability is particularly dangerous, considering how a malicious user can upload a .jsp file into the web root and execute code as SYSTEM on the vulnerable server without needing to authenticate itself.

Balwurk discovered that the JSON Web Token (JWT) implementation used to establish an authenticated session with the Write-Back manager, either from the manager web dashboard or from the plugin, was signed with a weak secret which could easily be brute-forced or extracted through data mining. What is Write-Back? Write-Back is a Tableau extension that enables users to submit data directly from a Tableau dashboard to your database, allowing them to implement any actionable use case without leaving the analysis flow. Write-Back allows users to take the Tableau usage further and implement use cases where you need users to input data, such as forecasting, planning, adding comments, or any actionable process.

Users will interact with the Write-Back extension through the Tableau dashboards that can be on different Tableau platforms, i.e. Tableau Desktop, Tableau Server, or even on Tableau Cloud. Write-Back Manager: Centralizes all configurations and enables platform administrators to fully control how Write-Back is configured. All of this is done on a web UI. Each Write-Back installation has its own Write-Back manager deployed on the same machine, allowing one to manage that instance. Technical Description By digging through Write-Back's Windows installation folders, it was possible to find multiple configuration files with clear-text hard-coded settings. One of these settings was the secret-key used to sign the JWT tokens generated upon a successful authentication, either from the Manager's web application or from the Tableau addon. If we look at the file C:\\Program Files\\Xpand-IT\\Write-Back\\manager\\apache-tomcat\\webapps\\writeback-manager\\WEB-INF\\classes\\config.yml it\u2019s possible to quickly identify the following section: Figure 1: Hardcoded JWT secret in configuration file Alternatively, we could have obtained the secret-key from the JWT token itself since the secret is susceptible to brute force. To help my analysis, I used the jwt_tool toolset: https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool. Just by deconstructing the token, we can easily find which claim holds the user identifier: Figure 2: Token Deconstruction To brute force the secret, I performed a classic dictionary attack. The first step is to select a good wordlist; if we ask Google for a common JWT secrets list, we can easily find the following: https://github.com/wallarm/jwt-secrets/blob/master/jwt.secrets.list , which will be more than enough. For awareness purposes, the brute-forcing process was timed, with the results observable in the following picture: Figure 3: JWT timed dictionary attack The secret was cracked in 160ms, and along with the remaining information collected, an attacker could now tamper with the claims in the token and sign it. Another important detail observed from the deconstruction of the JWT is that the host claim is set to localhost as a default value, as is the app claim, which is always set to Write-Back. This means that since there is no other claim serving as a differentiator between instances, the token can also be reused to establish a session with another unrelated manager instance without requiring to actually authenticate as a user, as long as the app and host claims provided are correct. Impact This vulnerability will allow an attacker to rebuild the JWT token and access the application as any other user, even if not previously authenticated. Effectively compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the Write-Back system as a whole, since the tokens used by the add-on were signed using the same secret, so both the Write-Back manager and Write-Back plugin sessions are vulnerable to spoofing.

Outsystems overview To aid the reader, a small overview is provided: Outsystems is a Portuguese unicorn company that developed and maintains a low-code development platform, providing tools for companies to develop, deploy and manage omnichannel enterprise applications. Technical description When assessing a given endpoint, specifically testing for HTTP request smuggling. A curious behaviour was observed when performing a POST request with a spoofed content length header, with a modified value higher than the actual body length. So doing something like this: POST /books/ HTTP/1.2 host: test.tld content-length: 100 ... uuid=12332&author=john Caused the server to hang indefinitely, the expected behaviour in this situation would be to timeout the request since the server never got the missing bytes specified in the request's header. Obviously the first thing that came to mind was to open a lot of paralel connections and see if the server would be able to keep up. This is when the exploit formally materializes, by creating multiple concurrent HTTP connections using POST HTTP requests, in which the body's content is transmitted very slowly and in small blobs I was able to force the server to maintain multiple active connections and exhaust computational resources achieving a successful DoS attack. The attack afected everything from the API, to Outsystem's user dashboard and IIS static page. This type of denial of service is commonly called R.U.D.Y 'R U Dead Yet?' it's a low-and-slow denial attack, in which the attacker hunts for an endpoint that accepts a POST request and then exhausts the server by keeping multiple connections tied up in a minimal bandwidth consumption session. The attack can be replicated with a tool like slowhttptest, : slowhttptest -c 10000 -B -o slowhttp -r 200 -u http://host.tld/endpointPostRoute During our tests, less than 500 simultaneous connections were sufficient to make the server unresponsive. Root cause We estimate the cause of this vulnerability lies in the default IIS webserver deployed as part of the outsystems plaftorm server stack. Impact This vulnerability has the potential to impact all outsystems applications deployed with the platform's server default IIS configurations. The exploit has a low complexity and is easily reproduced using multiple existing online tools, a single computer could deactivate a server and without propper mitigation, vulnerable systems are easy targets to Mitigation No official fix or patch yet, although some hotfixes can be applied: Configure a hard timeout, cutting off lingering TCP and HTTP sessions after a sensible amount of time. Set a maximum number of concurrent connections allowed from a single source. Implement general brute-force attacks prevention measures.
